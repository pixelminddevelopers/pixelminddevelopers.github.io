      <div class="legal-card-header">
        <h2>General Refund Policy</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        All refund requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the stage of the project
        and the services already delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        By making a payment, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and agreed to this Refund Policy.

      </div>
      <p>
        If a project has not yet started and no work has been initiated,
        the client may be eligible for a full refund upon request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refund requests must be submitted within a reasonable time after payment
        and before any active work begins.

      <p>
        If a project has been started and partially completed,
        a partial refund may be issued based on the amount of work already completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The refunded amount, if any, will be calculated after deducting costs
        related to time, effort, resources, and delivered components.

        refunds are not applicable.
      </p>
